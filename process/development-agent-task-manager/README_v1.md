# Development Agent Task Manager v1

## Purpose

This control-plane workflow turns a development specification into a durable, supervised sequence of ordinary ChatGPT web development agents.

The task manager is derived from the existing browser-agent watchdog architecture. It deliberately reuses:

- `.github/actions/setup-browser-agent-runtime`
- `scripts/browser-agent-wake.mjs`
- the existing Browserless / Browserbase / GitHub-hosted browser-provider redundancy
- the existing short scheduled-sweep model

It does **not** create another browser driver or another private-repository workflow system.

All GitHub Actions workflows remain in `CurveYield2/Contract-Automation`. `CurveYield2/Audit-Controller` must not gain GitHub Actions workflows.

## Starting a managed development task

Two equivalent start surfaces feed the **same** task-manager workflow.

### Declarative request file — preferred for automation

Create exactly one JSON file per commit under:

`process/development-agent-task-manager/requests/<REQUEST_ID>.json`

using schema:

`protocol/schemas/curveyield-development-agent-task-request-v1.schema.json`

A push of that file to `main` triggers the existing `.github/workflows/development-agent-task-manager.yml` start lane automatically. No second workflow or external dispatcher is introduced.

The request binds:
- stable manager ID;
- specification path;
- supporting skill/authority path;
- authority ref;
- target repository;
- durable target branch;
- base ref if needed;
- optional initial assignment.

If the same manager ID already has active state, request-file intake fails closed rather than spawning a duplicate agent.

### Manual workflow dispatch

The same workflow can also be dispatched manually with:

- `operation=start`
- a stable `manager_id`
- `specification_path` in Contract-Automation
- `skill_path` / supporting authority file in Contract-Automation
- exact `authority_ref`
- target repository
- durable target branch
- base ref if the durable target branch does not yet exist
- optional extra assignment text

The start lane:

1. reads the specification and skill authority bytes;
2. records SHA-256 identities for both;
3. resolves or creates the durable target branch;
4. creates a fresh ChatGPT development chat with the existing browser-agent driver;
5. stores the chat URL, branch checkpoint and response policy under:
   `process/development-agent-task-manager/active/<SAFE_MANAGER_ID>.json`.

The scheduled supervisor re-verifies the admitted specification and skill bytes before each sweep. Authority drift fails closed.

## Liveness and failure rule

The scheduled manager checks active workers approximately every five minutes.

A currently generating worker or a chat whose assistant output advanced is left alone.

When the worker is idle, liveness is tested with a direct prompt. A worker is declared dead only by either of these signals:

1. the target conversation is no longer viewable; or
2. three consecutive prompts receive no assistant response.

For case 2, the sequence is exact:

`prompt 1 → wait up to 120 seconds → refresh → prompt 2 → wait up to 120 seconds → refresh → prompt 3 → wait up to 120 seconds`

There is **no five-minute delay between the three attempts**. Attempts 2 and 3 refresh the browser page immediately before posting.

A browser-provider outage is not treated as agent death. If all configured browser providers fail, the current worker is preserved and the next scheduled sweep retries.

## Recovery and replacement

When a worker is confirmed dead:

1. the manager reads the exact current target-branch HEAD;
2. that checkpoint, predecessor chat URL and failure reason are written durably to the manager state on `main`;
3. only after the checkpoint write succeeds does the manager create a fresh ChatGPT conversation;
4. the replacement receives the exact specification identity, skill identity, target branch and checkpoint commit;
5. the replacement is explicitly told to reconstruct current GitHub state and continue without repeating completed work;
6. the new chat URL replaces the dead chat URL in durable manager state.

The repository checkpoint, not chat memory, is the recovery authority.

## Completion

A chat message saying “done” is not completion.

The development worker must commit:

`process/development-agent-task-manager/completions/<SAFE_MANAGER_ID>.json`

on the target branch using schema:

`protocol/schemas/curveyield-development-task-completion-v1.schema.json`

The receipt must bind:

- manager ID;
- specification SHA-256;
- skill SHA-256;
- implementation commit;
- one or more verification/test records, all with `status: PASS`.

The completion-receipt commit itself must be the current target-branch HEAD and its first parent must equal `implementationHeadSha`. This prevents a stale completion receipt or unrelated later changes from retiring the manager.

After verification, the active manager state is moved to:

`process/development-agent-task-manager/completed/<SAFE_MANAGER_ID>.json`

and supervision stops.

## Audit automation upgrade authority

The first admitted development specification is:

`process/development-agent-task-manager/specifications/AUDIT_AUTOMATION_UPGRADE_SPECIFICATION_v1.md`

Expected SHA-256:

`b23743f626cc159f869f22bfa4921b50ed103f600c4e7981d94463861dd1b86a`

The human-supplied Audit V7 v38.3.4 top-level skill authority is pinned under:

`process/development-agent-task-manager/authority/audit-v7-v38.3.4/`

Start with:

`SKILL_AUTHORITY_INDEX_v1.md`

The index records the source package identity, the complete original `SKILL.md` SHA-256, and the exact five-part reconstruction order.

## Governing development ethos

Development agents must preserve these rules:

- inspect current GitHub state before coding;
- do not repeat completed work;
- reuse existing workflows/modules/processes first;
- extend or refactor an admitted primitive before creating a parallel one;
- create a new workflow only when no existing workflow can safely own the responsibility;
- never put a GitHub Actions workflow in Audit-Controller;
- preserve exact evidence/state identities;
- diagnose, repair, retry and verify failures;
- commit coherent progress so a successor can recover from GitHub alone;
- do not write the completion receipt until implementation and required tests/qualification actually pass.
