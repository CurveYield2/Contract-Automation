Current active files: collector workflow v5, repayment workflow/runner v10, helper source v3, collector source v3, README/task lock v6. Superseded files preserved exactly in CurveYield2/archive and removed from active repository. Workflow v10 cannot deploy and does not accept push events for live execution. Live requires manual workflow_dispatch, production environment fxmint-production, existing DEPLOYER_FX signer, mode live-broadcast, confirmation LIVE 100 FXUSD. Live debt is bound to 100070130433123808237 and current base fee plus priority must fit the cap.

Next action: owner manually launches live workflow if desired. The assistant did not initiate live financial execution. Do not interpret a simulation transaction hash as a mainnet receipt or repeat the already-completed first repayment intent.
